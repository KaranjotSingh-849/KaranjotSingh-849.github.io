        <h2 id = "start"><em>Starting</em> of Coding journey</h2>
        <h6>Someday in July, 2020,</h6>
        
        <p>From our <strong>maths</strong> teacher, I got to know about a cool site - <strong>Khan Academy</strong>. He recommended this for learning maths but I found about <em>coding</em> from here. Then I started learning coding here. Within 2 hours of starting on <em><strong>coding</strong></em> I made my first basic project. After that I kept learning and making more simple projects. </p>
        
        <h2 id = "finish"><em>Finishing</em> Intro to JS</h2>
        <h6> 15 November, 2020</h6>
        
        <p>On this day, I completed my first course on coding - <strong>Intro to JS</strong>. After completing, I had one thing sure in my mind that I will learn more coding and also had a goal of making something <em>really cool and valued</em>. Then I began learning advanced courses on <strong>PJS</strong> on KA but my interest in it <em>faded</em>. <br> So, I thought now its time to learn by <em>experimenting</em> with coding.</p>
        
        <h2 id = "first">My <em>first</em> hit project</h2>
        <h6> 25 November, 2020</h6>
        
        <p>After losing my interest in further <strong>PJS</strong> courses, I began looking other projects here and there. Meanwhile, I found games <em>amazing</em> and then I began looking for game ideas. <br>After getting inspired from a mobile game, I started making <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/i/4624061980688384">my first game</a> ~ <strong>Brick Blaster</strong> on 25 November, 2020. <br>While working on this game, a very wonderful thing happened ~ collab with <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/apexstudios/"><strong>Apex </strong></a> . <br> After working on this project for a few weeks, I released it on <em>12 December, 2020</em>. </p>
        
        <h2 id = "hit"><em>Hitting</em> the Hotlist </h2>
        <h6> 14 December, 2020</h6>
        
        <p><em>2 days</em> after releasing the project, it reached the hotlist with <strong>80+ votes</strong>. This was the first time any of my project reached the <em>hotlist</em> and to have more than 5 votes.<br> Now it has more than <strong>138 votes</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2 id = "second">Version <em>2</em> </h2>
        <h6> 16 December, 2020</h6>
        
        <p>Even before releasing Version 1, I had started working on <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/i/4929634758508544">Version 2 </a>and after working on it for <em>5 days</em>, I released it on <em>16 December, 2020.</em> <br> But since it didn't get the support I thought it would get I <em>re-released</em> it on <strong>22 December, 2020</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id = "html">Learning <strong>HTML</strong></h2>
        <h6> 14 December, 2020</h6>
        
        <p>While working on <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/i/4929634758508544"><strong>Version 2 </strong></a> of our game, I slowed down <em>production</em> of further versions and started learning <em>HTML</em>. <strong>Learning HTML</strong> is a cool experience and it allows us to do various things.<br>
        While learning HTML, I made a few projects which were given as projects in the course - like,<em> Project: Travel Webpage and Project: Recipe Book</em>.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id = "1sthtml"><em>1st</em> Individual HTML</h2>
        <h6> 15 December, 2020</h6>
        
        <p>After learning HTML for <em>one day</em>,  I thought I have enough experience to make an <em>own HTML page</em> and I made a page giving brief description of <strong>Instagram</strong> and named it - <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/instagram/5544170414882816">Instagram.</a> 
        </p>
        
        <h2 id = "new">What am I doing nowadays</h2>
        <h6> 23 December, 2020</h6>
        
        <p>Nowadays, I am learning HTML and improving myself in every possible way. I am currently learning <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/web-development-tools/a/using-the-browser-developer-tools">Web development tools</a>. And also working on  <strong>Version 3</strong> of our game.<br>
        I will keep updating this section according to my schedule :D
